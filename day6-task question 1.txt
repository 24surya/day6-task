The class Movie is stated below. An instance of class Movie represents a film. This class has the following three properties:

title, which is a String representing the title of the movie
studio, which is a String representing the studio that made the movie
rating, which is a String representing the rating of the movie (i.e. PG­13, R, etc)
a) Write a constructor for the class Movie, which takes a String representing the title of the movie, a String representing the studio, and a String representing the rating as its arguments, and sets the respective class properties to these values.

ANSWER:
class Movie {
  constructor(title, studio, rating) {
    this.title = title;
    this.studio = studio;
    this.rating = rating;
  }
}

const myMovie = new Movie("singam-2", "avm", "R");

console.log("Title:", myMovie.title);
console.log("Studio:", myMovie.studio);
console.log("Rating:", myMovie.rating);

b) The constructor for the class Movie will set the class property rating to "PG" as default when no rating is provided.

class Movie {
  constructor(title, studio, rating = "PG") {
    this.title = title;
    this.studio = studio;
    this.rating = rating;
  }
}
const myMovie = new Movie("BOSS", "DISNIY");
console.log("Rating:", myMovie.rating); 


c) Write a method getPG, which takes an array of base type Movie as its argument, and returns a new array of only those movies in the input array with a rating of "PG". You may assume the input array is full of Movie instances. The returned array need not be full.


class movie {
  constructor(title, studio, rating) {
    this.title = title;
    this.studio = studio;
    this.rating = rating;
  }

  get PG() {
    return "the rating is  " + this.rating;
  }
}
var movie1 = new movie ("LIO","AVM","PG");
console.log(movie1.PG);



d) Write a piece of code that creates an instance of the class Movie with the title “Casino Royale”, the studio “Eon Productions”, and the rating “PG­13”


class Movie {
  constructor(title, studio, rating) {
    this.title = title;
    this.studio = studio;
    this.rating = rating;
  }
}
const casinoRoyale = new Movie("Casino Royale", "Eon Productions", "PG-13");
console.log("Title:", casinoRoyale.title);
console.log("Studio:", casinoRoyale.studio);
console.log("Rating:", casinoRoyale.rating);
